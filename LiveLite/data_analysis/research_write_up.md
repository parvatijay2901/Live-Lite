# Background On Obesity

Obesity is ever-growing issue in the modern world. Defined as "weight that is considered higher than what is
considered healthy for a given height" by the CDC. Body Mass Index (BMI) is a general method of defining obesity.
BMI in the ranges of 25 to 29.9 kg/m^2 are considered overweight and BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m^2 are considered
obese. Obesity is nowadays described as a chronic disease that is only increasing in prevalence in all ages and currently
now considered to be an ongoing global epidemic of obesity.


Using the NHANES data collected between the years of 1999 to 2018, we can observe that the prevalence of obesity
in the United States has progressively increased from **30.5** to **42.4** percent.

## Health Consequences of Obesity

Being overweight or obese is associated with grave morbidity and mortality. Obesity in adults has been previously
shown to be associated with a drastic reduction in life expectancy (Grover et al., 2015). Many studies across Europe and North America have
shown that mortality increased by 30 percent for each 5kg/m^2 increase in BMI (Prospective Studies Collaboration, 2009) 

Obesity has drastic implications on morbidity for obese individuals. The risks we will discuss can be categorized into the following
categories:
- Metabolic
- Cardiovascular
- Respiratory


### Metabolic - Type 2 Diabetes
Increased BMI and obesity are also strongly associated with Type 2 Diabetes mellitus. Similar to obesity,
type 2 diabetes has been dramatically increasing in the United States, with the most common feature being that
most patients who develop type 2 diabetes are of increased weight (Sullivan et al., 2005)


### Cardiovascular
Blood pressures is also often increased in obese individuals and puts them at risk of heart disease. Obesity
has been shown to be associated with increased risk of heart conditions such as coronary heart disease, heart failure,
and atrial fibrillation (Aune et al., 2016). A well known study in the field known as the Framingham Heart Study showed that every unit increase
in BMI was associated with about a 5 percent increase risk for developing atrial fibrillation (Wang et al., 2004).
In the same study, the risk of heart failure was also examined and was found that the risk of heart failure increased about two-fold in
individuals with obesity compared to their non-obese counterparts (Wang et al., 2004).

## Respiratory
The respiratory related health consequences of obesity were recently highlighted during the course of COVID-19 global
pandemic. A study in New York City during the pandemic showed that patients with COVID-19 who were obese were more at risk
of requiring intuition and more at risk of mortality (Anderson et al., 2020). Another study showed that obesity was associated with 113 percent higher risk
of hospitalization, 74 percent higher risk of ICU admission, and had a 48 percent higher risk of mortality (Popkin et al., 2020).

These risks are not tied to only COVID. Other respiratory conditions have similar increased risks of morbidity in individuals
who are obese versus non-obese. For example, adult obesity patients were found to have between two to fourfold increased risk
of being hospitalized for asthma exacerbations compared to their non-obese counterparts (Holguin et al., 2011), (Mosen et al., 2008).


## Trends
According to data published by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), obesity is a major risk factor for
mortality in not just the United States but globally as well.

Figure 1: (insert background_information_ihme(years=[1990, 2019]))

From Figure 1, we can observe that Deaths attributed to high body-mass index (BMI) has rapidly increased since 1990 - 
going from around 4.3 million to around 10 million.

Figure 2: (insert background_information_nhanes())

From Figure 2, we can observe that, in the United States alone, the proportion of overweight (including obese) and obese
individuals has rapidly increased since 1999.

Figure 3: (insert obesity_trends())

From Figure 3, we can observe that for both males and females, obesity has only increased since 1999.

Figure 4: (insert violin_plot_manager(years=[1999, 2017]))

Figure 4 displays the overall distribution of BMI in the NHANES data set between 1999 and 2017. The mean BMI in 1999
was 24.89. The mean BMI in 2017 was 26.58. From 1999 to 2017, there was a 6.76% increase in overall BMI in the United States.
In addition, in 1999, the average BMI was still under the category of "Healthy Weight". However, in 2017 with the increase
in BMI to 26.58, the average BMI is no longer considered "Healthy" and is now firmly in the "Overweight" category.
