# Milestones
## Project Overview 
The project aims to develop a comprehensive software solution to educate users about obesity and provide personalized recommendations (specifically, for physical activities and diet). The solution will consist of two main sections: Obesity Data Analysis section and a Recommendation tool section. 

## Project Roles and Responsibilities 

- **Manasa Shivappa Ronur:** Designer – Keep Everyone accountable for documentation, design, and communication with instructors. 
- **Ted Liu:** Developer – Focus on making sure everyone makes good implementation decisions. 
- **Saikripa Mohan:** Tester – Ensure everyone keeps up with good code testing and style practices.  
- **Parvati Jayakumar:** Project Manager – Run standups and keep track of Milestone progress. 

## Project Phases  

### Phase I: Development 
### Exploratory Data Analysis on the Obesity Datasets
- **Lead:** Ted Liu 

- **Description:**
    - Perform data analysis on the obesity datasets: Understand lifestyle factors influencing Obesity, Analyse obesity trends over time, etc (v1).  
    - Have visualizations illustrating these observations(v1).  
    - Provide a writeup for the observations/conclusions drawn from the analysis in a format to be included on the Streamlit app (v1). 
    - **Expected Completion:** v1 - 02/13/2024 

### Recommender Tool 

**Model the Obesity Risk (%)** 

- **Lead:** Manasa Shivappa Ronur 

- **Description:** 
    - Develop a machine learning model to predict obesity risk for users who are not obese (v1).  
    - **Expected Completion:** v1 - 02/13/2024 

**Physical Activity Recommender** 

- **Lead:** Manasa Shivappa Ronur 

- **Description:** 
    - Design a basic personalized physical activity recommender system based on the user’s and ML model's output (v1). 
    - If time permits, incorporate more factors into the recommendation algorithm (such as fitness goals,  any health conditions, etc) and utilize advanced ML techniques, such as collaborative filtering to improve the accuracy of personalized recommendations (v2/v3).  
    - **Expected Completion:** v1 - 02/13/2024 

**Diet Recommender** 

- **Lead:** Saikripa Mohan 

- **Description:** 
    - Develop a basic personalized diet recommender system based on the user’s nutritional requirements, dietary preferences, and ML model's output (v1). 
    - If time permits, incorporate more factors into the recommendation algorithm (such as allergies,  any health conditions, etc) to suggest specific recipes and utilize advanced ML techniques, such as collaborative filtering to improve the accuracy of personalized recommendations (v2/v3).  
    - **Expected Completion:** v1 – 02/13/2024 

**Integration and Dashboard Design** 

- **Lead:** Parvati Jayakumar 

- **Description:** 
    - Merge the outputs from Ted, Manasa, and Saikripa's work while handling the edge cases (v1).  
    - Design and develop a user-friendly Streamlit dashboard for easy access to the the data analysis and recommendations (v1). 
    - Design a develop a format to better design the recommender tool (v2). 
    - **Expected Completion:** v1 - 02/15/2024, v2 – 02/20/2024 

### Phase II: Testing and Refinement 

**Leads:** 
- **Testing:** Saikripa Mohan 
- **Refinement Design:** Manasa Shivappa Ronur 
- **Refinement Development:** Ted Liu 
- **Integration:** Parvati Jayakumar 

**Description:** 

**Testing:** 
- The integrated streamlit app will undergo testing to ensure functionality, usability, and reliability. Each component, including the data analysis part, ML model, recommendation systems, and dashboard design, will be tested individually and collectively. Each team member will test other team member’s work (Testing Lead is responsible for dividing up the work) and provide a summary to the Testing Lead - **Timeline:** 02/15/2024 to 03/06/2024. 
- Based on the feedbacks received on 03/07/2024, testing will be performed focusing on the feedbacks - **Timeline:** 03/07/2024 to 03/11/2024. 

**Refinement:** 
- After each testing, Testing Lead will reach out to the design lead who then works with the development lead to decide what refinements need to be implemented. Refinement Development Lead takes the responsibility in assigning who needs to do what refinement - **Timeline:** 02/15/2024 to 03/05/2024. 
- Based on the feedbacks received on 03/07/2024, further refinements will be performed focusing on the feedbacks - **Timeline:** 03/07/2024 to 03/11/2024. 

**Integration:** 
- Integration lead is responsible for maintaining the project repository – ensures that all the commits are made to the right folder in the right format. 
- Any refinement made to a section, will be taken into account by the integration lead, who then also will be responsible for implementing the changes to the streamlit dashboard. 
- **Timeline:** 02/15/2024 to 03/12/2024. 

### Phase III: Documentation 
- **Lead:** Manasa Shivappa Ronur 
- The documentation lead is responsible for assigning individual roles and keeping everyone accountable for the main documentation. 
- **Timeline:** 02/13/2024 to 03/12/2024.
