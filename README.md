# Live Lite: Empowering You to Rewrite Your Obesity Story

## Project Type
**Research** and a Recommendation **Tool**

## Questions of Interest
### Research
1. How have the indicators of weight and BMI changed over time in the United States?
2. Has there been a noticeable change in obesity levels within different demographics (age groups, genders, and race/ethnicities) in the United States?
3. Has there been an observable change the in physical activity levels within the US population over time?
4. How do dietary choices, particularly those related to the consumption of fruits and vegetables, correlate with obesity levels?
5. What other lifestyle factors significantly contribute to obesity/high BMI?
   - For example, does income status influence obesity rates?

### Tool 
1. How can we offer personalized recommendations for diet and physical activity by considering the user input, for example:
   - BMI (Height, Weight)
   - Demographic information (Sex at Birth, Age)
   - Dietary choices
   - Physical activity levels
   - Other lifestyle factors
2. In what ways can the tool account for individual preferences in dietary and physical activity recommendations?
   - How can the tool accommodate users with different dietary preferences, such as vegetarianism or specific medical conditions like diabetes?
   - How can the tool accommodate users with different preferences in physical activity levels, considering factors such as varying fitness levels or specific medical conditions and physical limits?
3. Can the tool suggest additional lifestyle recommendations based on the findings from the research?

## Project Outcome
1. Conduct a comprehensive analysis to understand how obesity levels and lifestyle factors (particularly physical activity levels and dietary choices) have evolved over time and across diverse demographics.
2. Explore potential associations and correlations between physical activities, dietary habits, and obesity levels to gain a better understanding of these contributing factors.
3. Create a tool that provides personalized lifestyle suggestions (particularly diet and physical activity) for individuals with obesity/high BMI levels.
