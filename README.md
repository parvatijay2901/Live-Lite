## Project Type
**Research** and a Recommendation **Tool**

## Questions of Interest
### Research
1. How have the indicators of weight and BMI changed over time in the United States?
2. Has there been a noticeable change in obesity levels within different demographics (age groups, genders, and race/ethnicities) in the United States?
3. Has there been an observable change the in physical activity levels within the US population over time?
4. How do dietary choices, particularly those related to the consumption of fruits and vegetables, correlate with obesity levels?
5. What other lifestyle factors significantly contribute to obesity/high BMI?
For example,
   -  does income status influence obesity rates?
   - do habits like smoking, drinking lead to obesity?


## Project Outcome
1. Conduct a comprehensive analysis to understand how obesity levels and lifestyle factors (particularly physical activity levels and dietary choices) have evolved over time and across diverse demographics.
2. Explore potential associations and correlations between physical activities, dietary habits, and obesity levels to gain a better understanding of these contributing factors.
3. Create a tool that provides personalized lifestyle suggestions (particularly diet and physical activity) for individuals with obesity/high BMI levels.

### Tool Features
1. Tool will show case the visualizations answering our research questions, to educate users about obesity.
2. Tool will let users input their personal data, for example:
   - BMI (Height, Weight)
   - Demographic information (Sex at Birth, Age)
   - Dietary choices
   - Physical activity levels
   - Other lifestyle factors (for example, sleeping habits)
3. Based on the input, and the model built, tool will predict the obesity risk, and make recommendations for healthy lifestyle. The recommendations include
   - Expected calorie intake
   - Right food choices
   - Physical activities (running, swimming etc)
4. Extended features (These features are nice to have and will be delivered based on time & resource availability)
   - Along with food choices, recommend healthy recipes that includes the raw ingredient.
   - Consider other health factors about users such as known conditions like pregnancy, diabetes, physical disability etc.
